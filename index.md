I am a fifth year undergraduate student at [IIT Madras](www.iitm.ac.in). My research interests are broadly in the fields of **Optimal Control** and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am currently working on modelling behaviours using deep reinforcement learning, advised by [Dr. Balaram Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/).

I am a fifth year undergraduate student at [IIT Madras](www.iitm.ac.in). My research interests are broadly in the fields of **Optimal Control** and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am currently working on modelling behaviours using deep reinforcement learning, advised by [Dr. Balaram Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/).


My Bachelors degree is focused in Aerospace Engineering. I spent the majority of my junior year working with [Dr. Ranjith Mohan](https://home.iitm.ac.in/ranjith.m/md/ranj.html) on **trajectory optimization** for dynamic soaring aircraft. We utilized a pseudospectral collocation approach to arrive at stable dynamic soaring trajectories. Our methodology and results are recorded in detail in the manuscript published in AIAA's Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.
